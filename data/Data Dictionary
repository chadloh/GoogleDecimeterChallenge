PseudorangeRateUncertaintyMetersPerSecond - The pseudorange's rate uncertainty (1-sigma) in m/s.

AccumulatedDeltaRangeState - This indicates the state of the 'Accumulated Delta Range' measurement. Each bit in the integer attributes to state of the measurement. See the metadata/accumulated_delta_range_state_bit_map.json file for the mapping between bits and states.

AccumulatedDeltaRangeMeters - The accumulated delta range since the last channel reset, in meters.

AccumulatedDeltaRangeUncertaintyMeters - The accumulated delta range's uncertainty (1-sigma) in meters

CarrierFrequencyHz - The carrier frequency of the tracked signal.

MultipathIndicator - A value indicating the 'multipath' state of the event.

ConstellationType - GNSS constellation type. The mapping to human readable values is provided in the metadata/constellation_type_mapping.csv file.

CodeType - The GNSS measurement's code type. Only available in recent logs.

ChipsetElapsedRealtimeNanos - The elapsed real-time of this clock since system boot, in nanoseconds. Only available in recent logs.

ArrivalTimeNanosSinceGpsEpoch - An integer number of nanoseconds since the GPS epoch (1980/1/6 midnight UTC). Its value equals round((Raw::TimeNanos - Raw::FullBiasNanos), for each unique epoch described in the Raw sentences.

RawPseudorangeMeters - Raw pseudorange in meters. It is the product between the speed of light and the time difference from the signal transmission time (receivedSvTimeInGpsNanos) to the signal arrival time (Raw::TimeNanos - Raw::FullBiasNanos - Raw;;BiasNanos). Its uncertainty can be approximated by the product between the speed of light and the ReceivedSvTimeUncertaintyNanos.

SignalType - The GNSS signal type is a combination of the constellation name and the frequency band. Common signal types measured by smartphones include GPS_L1, GPS_L5, GAL_E1, GAL_E5A, GLO_G1, BDS_B1I, BDS_B1C, BDS_B2A, QZS_J1, and QZS_J5.

ReceivedSvTimeNanosSinceGpsEpoch - The signal transmission time received by the chipset, in the numbers of nanoseconds since the GPS epoch. Converted from ReceivedSvTimeNanos, this derived value is in a unified time scale for all constellations, while ReceivedSvTimeNanos refers to the time of day for GLONASS and the time of week for non-GLONASS constellations.

SvPosition[X/Y/Z]EcefMeters - The satellite position (meters) in an ECEF coordinate frame at best estimate of “true signal transmission time” defined as ttx = receivedSvTimeInGpsNanos - satClkBiasNanos (defined below). They are computed with the satellite broadcast ephemeris, and have ~1-meter error with respect to the true satellite position.

Sv[Elevation/Azimuth]Degrees - The elevation and azimuth in degrees of the satellite. They are computed using the WLS estimated user position.

SvVelocity[X/Y/Z]EcefMetersPerSecond - The satellite velocity (meters per second) in an ECEF coordinate frame at best estimate of “true signal transmission time” ttx. They are computed with the satellite broadcast ephemeris, with this algorithm.

SvClockBiasMeters - The satellite time correction combined with the satellite hardware delay in meters at the signal transmission time (receivedSvTimeInGpsNanos). Its time equivalent is termed as satClkBiasNanos. satClkBiasNanos equals the satelliteTimeCorrection minus the satelliteHardwareDelay. As defined in IS-GPS-200H Section 20.3.3.3.3.1, satelliteTimeCorrection is calculated from ∆tsv = af0 + af1(t - toc) + af2(t - toc)2 + ∆tr, while satelliteHardwareDelay is defined in Section 20.3.3.3.3.2. Parameters in the equations above are provided on the satellite broadcast ephemeris.

SvClockDriftMetersPerSecond - The satellite clock drift in meters per second at the signal transmission time (receivedSvTimeInGpsNanos). It equals the difference of the satellite clock biases at t+0.5s and t-0.5s.

IsrbMeters - The Inter-Signal Range Bias (ISRB) in meters from a non-GPS-L1 signal to GPS-L1 signals. For example, when the isrbM of GPS L5 is 1000m, it implies that a GPS L5 pseudorange is 1000m longer than the GPS L1 pseudorange transmitted by the same GPS satellite. It's zero for GPS-L1 signals. ISRB is introduced in the GPS chipset level and estimated as a state in the Weighted Least Squares engine.

IonosphericDelayMeters - The ionospheric delay in meters, estimated with the Klobuchar model.

TroposphericDelayMeters - The tropospheric delay in meters, estimated with the EGNOS model by Nigel Penna, Alan Dodson and W. Chen (2001).

WlsPositionXEcefMeters - WlsPositionYEcefMeters,WlsPositionZEcefMeters: User positions in ECEF estimated by a Weighted-Least-Square (WLS) solver.
